# tcds-tda4emotion

This is the demo code for the paper "Toplogical EEG Nonlinear Dynamics Analysis for Emotion Recognition," published on IEEE TCDS at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9772625.

The datasets of DEAP and DREAMER are validated with the topological approach analysis.

The core ideas are covered in the project, and we apologize that there might be some ugly codes.
